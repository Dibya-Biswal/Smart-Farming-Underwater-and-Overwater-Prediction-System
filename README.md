# Smart-Farming-Underwater-and-Overwater-Prediction-System
# This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for optimiz4 ing irrigation in smart farming, focusing on Rice plants. The system analyzes plant images .It classifies fields as healthy or unhealthy (over7 watered or underwatered) , providing tailored watering schedules. Emphasizing robustness, the system adapts to variations in soil and light10 ing, ensuring real-time processing for practical use in farming. User-friendly for non-tech-savvy farmers, it prioritizes cost-effectiveness. Performance met14 rics include CNN accuracy, improved crop yield, and reduced water usage. This project repre16 sents a significant AI application in traditional farming, enhancing efficiency and sustainabil1ity.
